hate thou wilt euer now now world bent deed cross 
ioyn spight fortun make bow doe drop loss ah doe 
heart have scapt sorrow come rereward conquerd woe giue windi 
night raini morrow linger purposd ouer-throw thou wilt leaue leaue 
last petti grief haue do spight onset come tast first 
worst fortun might strain woe now seem woe compar would 
loss thee seem
