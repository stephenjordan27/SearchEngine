vpon bough shake bare ruin would quier late sweet bird 
sing thou seest twi-light dai sun-set fadeth west black night 
doth take awai death second self seal vp rest thou 
seest glow fire ash youth doth lye death bed whereon 
must expir consum would nurrisht thou perceu  st make 
thy loue strong loue well thou must leaue er long
