My toung-tide Muse in manners holds her still,
While comments of your praise richly compil’d,
Reserue their Character with goulden quill,
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil’d.
I thinke good thoughts, whilst other write good wordes,
And like vnlettered clarke still crie Amen,
To euery Himne that able spirit affords,
In polisht forme of well refined pen.
Hearing you praisd, I say ’tis so, ’tis true,
And to the most of praise adde some-thing more,
But that is in my thought, whose loue to you
(Though words come hind-most) holds his ranke before,
Then others, for the breath of words respect,
Me for my dombe thoughts, speaking in effect.
