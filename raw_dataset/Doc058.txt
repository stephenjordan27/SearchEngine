That God forbid, that made me first your slaue,
I should in thought controule your times of pleasure,
Or at your hand th’ account of houres to craue,
Being your vassail bound to staie your leisure.
Oh let me suffer (being at your beck)
Th’ imprison’d absence of your libertie,
And patience tame, to sufferance bide each check,
Without accusing you of iniury.
Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
That you your selfe may priuiledge your time
To what you will, to you it doth belong,
Your selfe to pardon of selfe-doing crime.
I am to waite, though waiting so be hell,
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
